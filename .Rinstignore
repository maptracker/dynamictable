## Putting PNG files somewhere where they will not irritate package
## installation, but not get installed either. They do not need to
## copy over images, they've already been serialized in CSS:

pngs/.*.png$
pngs/.*.sh$
pngs/README

## Eh. Can't seem to make the installed empty pngs directory itself go away...

pngs/


README.md
PubD-Disclosure-Approval.md

.git
.gitignore
.+~
