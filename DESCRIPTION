Description: Designed to be easy to use but also highly customizable, while generating light-weight self-contained HTML pages. Takes data.frame-compliant structures, arrays, matrices or vectors as input. Generates a single HTML file with a table that includes some dynamic features including sorting, filtering and dynamic truncation of long text. Styling can also be applied to factor levels and as gradients for numerical data.
