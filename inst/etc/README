These files provide the supporting code (CSS and Javascript) used by
the user's web browser to provide dynamic functionality to the HTML
table. The code will be copied directly into the HTML document (as
<style> and <script> blocks), rather than linked to; This is a design
decision to assure that the resulting output document is stand-alone.

Wtihin `dynamictable.R` the relevant calls are from `.cssStyles()` and
`.jsCode()`, both utilizing `.readSupporting()` to read the files
contained in this directory.
