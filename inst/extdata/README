I wanted some data sets to demonstrate factor level faceting in
basichtmltables; That is, I was looking for data sets to highlight the
ability to toggle row visibility based on factor level. Unfortunately
there are not many such sets in R, most are entirely numeric. A
notable exception is `lattice::barley`, but it is not part of the core
data sets, and has somewhat mundane levels.

These data sets were chosen because:

* They have multiple factor columns
* They have a permissive license (Wikipedia CC-BY-SA)
* They were reasonably sized and modestly interesting
* They seemed unlikely to make anyone unhappy

The final R objects include (as attributes) the URL the data were
pulled from, as well as the date the data were recovered. They are
constructed from TSV files using scripts in `inst/rawTSV`.

Some amount of post-processing was performed, for example removing
"[12]"-type footnote references or removing low-information columns.
