These are small PNG files used for HTML UI components (eg sort and
filter buttons). An included shell script simply calculates the base64
serialized representation of each image, which are then (manually)
added to the style declarations in `../etc/basichtmltable.css`.

While the original content of the directory is excluded from the
installation, I have not been able to figure out how to remove the
directory itself, so I am leaving this README as an explanation. The
curious can browse the basichtmltable source repository for the
original PNG files.
